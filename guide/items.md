## Items

`extern crate` statements must be first in a file. They must be ordered
alphabetically.

`use` statements, and module *declarations* (`mod foo;`, not `mod { ... }`)
must come before other items. We recommend that imports come before module
declarations; if imports and modules are separated, then they should be ordered
alphabetically.

Tools should make the above ordering optional.


### Function definitions

In Rust, one finds functions by searching for `fn [function-name]`; It's
important that you style your code so that it's very searchable in this way.

The proper ordering and spacing is:

```rust
[pub] [unsafe] [extern ["ABI"]] fn foo(arg1: i32, arg2: i32) -> i32 {
    ...
}
```

Avoid comments within the signature itself.

### Tuples and tuple structs

Write the type list as you would a parameter list to a function.

Build a tuple or tuple struct as you would call a function.

#### Single-line

```rust
struct Bar(Type1, Type2);

let x = Bar(11, 22);
let y = (11, 22, 33);
```

### Enums

In the declaration, put each variant on its own line, block indented.

Format each variant accordingly as either a struct, tuple struct, or identifier,
which doesn't require special formatting (but without the `struct` keyword.

```rust
enum FooBar {
    First(u32),
    Second,
    Error {
        err: Box<Error>,
        line: u32,
    },
}
```

If a struct variant is *short* (TODO link to definition), it may be formatted on
one line. In this case, do not use a trailing comma for the field list, but do
put spaces around braces:

```rust
enum FooBar {
    Error { err: Box<Error>, line: u32 },
}
```

In an enum with multiple struct variants, if any struct variant is written on
multiple lines, then the multi-line formatting should be used for all struct
variants. However, such a situation might be an indication that you should
factor out the fields of the variant into their own struct.


### Structs and Unions

Struct names follow on the same line as the `struct` keyword, with the opening
brace on the same line when it fits within the right margin. All struct fields
are indented once and end with a trailing comma. The closing brace is not
indented and appears on its own line.

```rust
struct Foo {
    a: A,
    b: B,
}
```

If and only if the type of a field does not fit within the right margin, it is
pulled down to its own line and indented again.

```rust
struct Foo {
    a: A,
    long_name: 
        LongType,
}
```

Prefer using a unit struct to an empty struct (these only exist to simplify code
generation), but if you must use an empty struct, keep it on one line with no
space between the braces: `struct Foo;` or `struct Foo {}`.

The same guidelines are used for untagged union declarations.

```rust
union Foo {
    a: A,
    b: B,
    long_name: 
        LongType,
}
```

### Tuple structs

Put the whole struct on one line if possible. Types in the parentheses should be
separated by a comma and space with no trailing comma. No spaces around the
parentheses or semi-colon:

```rust
pub struct Foo(String, u8);
```

Prefer unit structs to empty tuple structs (these only exist to simplify code
generation), e.g., `struct Foo;` rather than `struct Foo();`.

For more than a few fields, prefer a proper struct with named fields. Given
this, a tuple struct should always fit on one line. If it does not, block format
the fields with a field on each line and a trailing comma:

```rust
pub struct Foo(
    String,
    u8,
);
```


### Extern crate

`extern crate foo;`

Use spaces around keywords, no spaces around the semi-colon.

### Modules

```rust
mod foo {
}
```

```rust
mod foo;
```

Use spaces around keywords and before the opening brace, no spaces around the
semi-colon.

### macro\_rules!

Use `{}` for the full definition of the macro.

```rust
macro_rules! foo {
}
```

### Generics

TODO

If an associated type is bound in a generic type, then there should be spaces on
either side of the `=`:

```rust
<T: Example<Item = u32>>
```


### `where` clauses

These rules apply for `where` clauses on any item.

A `where` clause may immediately follow a closing bracket of any kind.
Otherwise, it must start a new line, with no indent. Each component of a `where`
clause must be on its own line and be block indented. There should be a trailing
comma, unless the clause is terminated with a semicolon. If the `where` clause
is followed by a block (or assignment), the block should be started on a new
line. Examples:

```rust
fn function<T, U>(args)
where
    T: Bound,
    U: AnotherBound,
{
    body
}

fn foo<T>(
    args
) -> ReturnType
where
    T: Bound,
{
    body
}

fn foo<T, U>(
    args,
) where
    T: Bound,
    U: AnotherBound,
{
    body
}

fn foo<T, U>(
    args
) -> ReturnType
where
    T: Bound,
    U: AnotherBound;  // Note, no trailing comma.

type Foo<T>
where
    T: Bound
= Bar<T>;
```

If a `where` clause is very short, we recommend using an inline bound on the
type parameter.


If a component of a `where` clause is long, it may be broken before `+` and
further block indented. Each bound should go on its own line. E.g.,

```rust
impl<T: ?Sized, Idx> IndexRanges<Idx> for T
where
    T: Index<Range<Idx>, Output = Self::Output>
        + Index<RangeTo<Idx>, Output = Self::Output>
        + Index<RangeFrom<Idx>, Output = Self::Output>
        + Index<RangeInclusive<Idx>, Output = Self::Output>
        + Index<RangeToInclusive<Idx>, Output = Self::Output> + Index<RangeFull>
```

#### Option - `where_single_line`

`where_single_line` is `false` by default. If `true`, then a where clause with
exactly one component may be formatted on a single line if the rest of the
item's signature is also kept on one line. In this case, there is no need for a
trailing comma and if followed by a block, no need for a newline before the
block. E.g.,

```rust
// May be single-lined.
fn foo<T>(args) -> ReturnType
where T: Bound {
    body
}

// Must be multi-lined.
fn foo<T>(
    args
) -> ReturnType
where
    T: Bound,
{
    body
}
```


### Type aliases

Type aliases should generally be kept on one line. If necessary to break the
line, do so after the `=`; the right-hand-side should be block indented:

```rust
pub type Foo = Bar<T>;

// If multi-line is required
type VeryLongType<T, U: SomeBound> =
    AnEvenLongerType<T, U, Foo<T>>;
```

Where possible avoid `where` clauses and keep type constraints inline. Where
that is not possible split the line before and after the `where` clause (and
split the `where` clause as normal), e.g.,

```rust
type VeryLongType<T, U>
where
    T: U::AnAssociatedType,
    U: SomeBound,
= AnEvenLongerType<T, U, Foo<T>>;
```


### Associated types

Associated types should follow the guidelines above for type aliases. Where an
associated type has a bound, there should be a space after the colon but not
before:

```rust
    pub type Foo: Bar;
```


### extern items

When writing extern items (such as `extern "C" fn`), always be explicit about
the ABI. For example, write `extern "C" fn foo ...`, not `extern fn foo ...`, or
`extern "C" { ... }.
